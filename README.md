## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rohit-girish-Belagali/kanyarasi.git
cd kanyarasi
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Google Gemini API Key
# Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSyCViQef6EDbOJEvaetIOTh6eoOfIM5uuYA"

# ElevenLabs API Key
# Get your API key from: https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="9097e483eca4f09ba180332f7d06bcac5014defc7ac980efb4247211597485aa"
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual Google Gemini API key
- Replace `your_elevenlabs_api_key_here` with your actual ElevenLabs API key
- **Never commit the `.env` file to Git** - it's already included in `.gitignore`

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you see an error like `EADDRINUSE: address already in use`, another process is using port 5001. You can:
1. Stop the other process
2. Or change the port in `server/index.ts`

### API Key Errors
If you see "Failed to get response" or "Speech synthesis failed":
1. Verify your API keys are correct in the `.env` file
2. Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the keys
3. Check that your API keys are active and have sufficient quota

### Module Not Found Errors
If you encounter module errors:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
